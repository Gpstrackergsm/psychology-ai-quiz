## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- npm

### Installation

From the repository root, install dependencies for both frontend and backend:

```bash
cd backend
npm install
cd ../frontend
npm install
```

### Running the App

Start the backend API:

```bash
cd backend
npm run dev
```

In a new terminal, launch the React development server:

```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

The frontend is available at `http://localhost:5173` and automatically proxies API requests to `http://localhost:4000`.

### Building for Production

```bash
cd frontend
npm run build
```

The output will be generated in `frontend/dist`.

## Customizing Books

Book recommendations live in [`backend/data/books.json`](backend/data/books.json). Each entry contains a `category`, `title`, `author`, `summary`, `coverImage`, and `purchaseLink`. Add or edit items to expand MindMatch with new focus areas or titles.

## Quiz Content

Quiz questions are stored in [`frontend/src/data/quizData.js`](frontend/src/data/quizData.js). Update prompts, options, categories, or scoring to match your programâ€™s needs.
